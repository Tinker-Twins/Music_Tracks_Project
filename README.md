# Music Tracks Project
This project creates a database of Music Tracks along with their Artists, Albums, Genres, Duration, Rating, etc. from an XML file.

To export your own Library.xml from iTunes:

File -> Library -> Export Library (Make sure to save it in the correct folder)

Note: iTUnes might change UI and/or export format any time!
